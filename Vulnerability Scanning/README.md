# Vulnerability Scanning With Nmap & Nikto

This Bash script automates the Nmap vulnerability scan and Nikto web vulnerability scanner to check a target web server for common security issues on port 80 or 443.

## Installation
1. Install Nikto:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nikto
```
2. Clone this Repo:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:codelassey/scripts-and-tools.git
   ```
   ```
   cd Vulnerability\ Scanning/
   ```
3. Make the scripts executable:
   ```
   sudo su
   ```
   ```
   chmod +x vulnerability-scan.sh
   ```
   ```
   chmod +x nikto_scan.sh
   ```
5. Run the script of your choice.
   For scanning with Nmap...
   ```
   ./vulnerability-scan.sh
   ```
   Then you will be asked to provide the target.

   For scanning with Nikto...
   Execute the script with a target and optional port:
   ```
   ./nikto_vuln_scan.sh <target> [port]
   ```
   Example (HTTP scan on port 80):
   ```
   ./nikto_vuln_scan.sh example.com
   ```
   Example (HTTPS scan on port 443):
   ```
   ./nikto_vuln_scan.sh example.com 443
   ```
   If no target is provided, the script prompts for one:
   > Enter target to check for vulnerabilities: example.com
