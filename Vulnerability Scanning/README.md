# Vulnerability Scanning With Nmap, Nikto, and Nuclei
This Bash script collection automates vulnerability scanning using Nmap, Nikto, and Nuclei to check a target web server or host for common security issues. The Nmap script scans for vulnerabilities using the vulners script, Nikto focuses on web vulnerabilities on port 80 or 443, and Nuclei scans for CVEs and exposures.

## Installation
- Install dependencies:
Nmap
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
```

Nikto
```
sudo apt install nikto
```

Nuclei
```
sudo apt install nuclei
```

- Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:codelassey/scripts-and-tools.git
cd scripts-and-tools/Vulnerability\ Scanning/
```

- Make the scripts executable:
```
sudo su
```
```
chmod +x vulnerability-scan.sh
```
```
chmod +x nikto_scan.sh
```
```
chmod +x nuclei_scan.sh
```

- Run the script of your choice.
## For scanning with Nmap:
Execute the Nmap vulnerability scan:
```
./vulnerability-scan.sh
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to provide a target (an IP or hostname):
```
Enter target for Vulnerability Scanning: example.com
```

Results are saved in `results/[target]_Vulnerability_Scan_Results/vuln-scan.txt`.


## For scanning with Nikto:

Execute the Nikto web vulnerability scan with a target and optional port:
```
./nikto_scan.sh <target> [port]
```

Example (HTTP scan on port 80):
```
./nikto_scan.sh example.com
```

Example (HTTPS scan on port 443):
```
./nikto_scan.sh example.com 443
```

If no target is provided, the script prompts for one:
```
Enter target for Vulnerability Scanning: example.com
```

Results are saved in `results/[target]_Vulnerability_Scan_Results/nikto-scan.txt`.


## For scanning with Nuclei:

Execute the Nuclei scan for CVEs and exposures:
```
./nuclei_scan.sh <target>
```

Example:
```
./nuclei_scan.sh example.com
```

If no target is provided, the script prompts for one:
```
Enter target for Vulnerability Scanning: example.com
```

The script automatically updates Nuclei templates before scanning.
Results are saved in `results/[target]_Vulnerability_Scan_Results/nuclei_scan.txt`.
